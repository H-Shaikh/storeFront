# storeFront
During the course of my project, I developed a RESTful API utilizing Django Rest Framework. My exploration of fundamental API concepts, such as pagination, nested routers, filtering, and searching, was both thorough and enlightening. Through a process of refinement, I enhanced my methodology by transitioning from function-based views to view sets and gained a deeper appreciation for their harmonious compatibility with generic views and mixins. As a crowning achievement, I seamlessly integrated the API with a MySQL database, showcasing my exceptional proficiency in Python and adeptness in database management.
